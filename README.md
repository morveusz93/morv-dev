# Morv Landing

A fast, conversion-focused landing page built with Next.js.  
Designed to test SEO, visibility, and real user interest — not to be a design playground.

---

---

## SEO

SEO is handled natively via Next.js:

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Optimized for deployment on Vercel, but works with any Next.js-compatible hosting.

## Status

MVP / Test version

Hero, CTA, and structure are intentionally frozen to collect real data before iteration.
